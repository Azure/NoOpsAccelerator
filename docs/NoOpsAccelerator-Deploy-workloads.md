# Deploy workloads into the landing zones

Now that you have the required platform set up and the Mission Landing Zones have been created and added to their respective management groups, they are secure, governed, monitored, and allowed for autonomy. Your application teams can now move workloads, migrate to them, and start working on brand-new developments there.

The workloads below are described here to help your application teams effectively deploy them into their landing zones. They also give best practices and curated deployment experiences (internal).
