## Azure NoOps Accelerator User Guide
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

The purpose of the Azure NoOps Accelerator User Guide is to provide comprehensive end-to-end documentation for the DOD/Public Sector customers on building self-service infrastucture in their Azure environment.

The reference implementation is a flexible foundation that enables users to develop/maintain an opinionated self-service infrastructure. These templates are created to help organizations move to a continious deployment of self-healing infrastructure.

Azure NoOps Accelerator Architecture supported up to IL6 (Top Secret) - Cloud Only Applications. This reference implementation is applicable to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) with characteristics:

* Cloud-based services hosting sensitive (up to IL6 (Top Secret)) information
* No direct system to system network interconnections required with data centers

This implementation is specific to DOD/Public Sector organizations.
