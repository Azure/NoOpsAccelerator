This guide describes how to deploy Mission Landing Zone using the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) template at [src/terraform/mlz](../src/terraform/mlz).

To get started with Terraform on Azure check out their [tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/azure-get-started/).

## Prerequisites

- Current version of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- The version of the [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) described in the [.devcontainer Dockerfile](../.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
- An Azure Subscription(s) where you or an identity you manage has `Owner` [RBAC permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)

> NOTE: Azure Cloud Shell is often our preferred place to deploy from because the AZ CLI and Terraform are already installed. However, sometimes Cloud Shell has different versions of the dependencies from what we have tested and verified, and sometimes there have been bugs in the Terraform Azure RM provider or the AZ CLI that only appear in Cloud Shell. If you are deploying from Azure Cloud Shell and see something unexpected, try the [development container](../.devcontainer) or deploy from your machine using locally installed AZ CLI and Terraform. We welcome all feedback and [contributions](../CONTRIBUTING.md), so if you see something that doesn't make sense, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Azure/missionlz/issues/new/choose) or open a [discussion thread](https://github.com/Azure/missionlz/discussions).
